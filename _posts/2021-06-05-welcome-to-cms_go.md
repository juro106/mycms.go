You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

golang

    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
	    fmt.Println("こんにちわ世界")
    }

javascript
    
    const greet = "Hello World?"
